# AD2 Design Project 2022
## Background
This is a HKUspace school project inspired by a big chopper signage located at Hong Kong Kowloon, the shop is called Leung Tim Choppers Factory. This shop has 60 years history, they produce extraordinary good quality knives with passion and even export to overseas. Due to the new building ordiance in HK the signage will soon be taken off in 2023.<br>

## Process
In this assignmnt we are asked to design a 5m x 5m x 5m shop. The attribute of "Drawing attention" or in Cantonese Êê∂Fo is extracted from Leung Tim chopper signage. And I used Rhino3D and grasshopper to do some parametric design, in which a function called random reduction is used.<br>
